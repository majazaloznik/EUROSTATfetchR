\title{Extract dimension structure from Eurostat dataset}
\usage{
extract_dimension_structure(code)
}
\arguments{
\item{code}{the original Eurostat code (e.g. agr_r_animal)}
}
\value{
a named list where each element is a dataframe with columns `level_value`
  and `level_text` for that dimension. Only dimensions with 2+ unique values are included.
}
\description{
Helper function that downloads a Eurostat dataset and extracts all dimensions
with their unique levels and labels. Dimensions with only one unique value are excluded
as they are constants rather than true dimensions. This output is used by both
prepare_table_dimensions_table and prepare_dimension_levels_table.
