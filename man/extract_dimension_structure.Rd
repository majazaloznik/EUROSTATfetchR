\title{Extract dimension structure from Eurostat dataset}
\usage{
extract_dimension_structure(code, use_cache = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{code}{the original Eurostat code (e.g. agr_r_animal)}

\item{use_cache}{logical, set to true for testing, false in production}
}
\value{
a list with three elements:
  - `dimensions`: a named list where each element is a dataframe with columns
    `level_value` and `level_text` for that dimension. Only dimensions with
    2+ unique values are included.
  - `interval`: a single character string with the interval code (e.g., "M", "A", "Q")
  - `unit_mapping`: a dataframe with dimension level columns plus a `unit` column,
    showing which unit applies to each dimension combination
}
\description{
Helper function that downloads a Eurostat dataset and extracts all dimensions
with their unique levels and labels, plus the frequency/interval and unit
mapping for each dimension combination. Dimensions with only one unique value
are excluded as they are constants rather than true dimensions.
